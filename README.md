## 🚀 Programs & Onboarding

This repository serves two distinct programs. Please follow the instructions for the program you are a part of.

### 1. Formal Internship Program

Welcome to MasterFabric! Our formal internship onboarding process is managed through our internal platform:

**MasterFabric Onboarding Platform:** [https://welcome.masterfabric.co](https://welcome.masterfabric.co)

Upon approval of your internship, our IT department will create your corporate email account (`internship.yourname@masterfabric.co`). Please use the internal platform to connect with your colleagues, access resources, and complete your onboarding checklist.

### 2. Open Trainee Program (MasterFabric Academy)

Welcome, future developer! As a trainee in our open, non-profit program, your journey starts right here in this repository.

**Getting Started Guide for Trainees:** [`/trainee/README.md`](./trainee/README.md)

## 🗓️ The 100-Day Pledge
Your success will be measured not only by task completion but also by **code quality**, **test coverage**, and your approach to **problem-solving**.

## 🎓 MasterFabric Academy (Non-Profit Initiative)

In addition to our internal internship, this repository is the home of the **MasterFabric Academy**, a non-profit, open-source initiative. We provide free learning roadmaps and a collaborative environment for external trainees who wish to build their skills by contributing to a real-world project.

This program is open to everyone. If you are a self-learner looking for guidance and hands-on experience, we welcome you to become a trainee.
