# Welcome to the MasterFabric Academy

We are thrilled to have you join us! This guide is your starting point for becoming a contributor and learner with the MasterFabric Academy, our non-profit, open-source educational initiative.

## Our Mission

The MasterFabric Academy is dedicated to providing open and accessible software development training to a global community. Our goal is to empower aspiring developers with practical, hands-on experience by building and contributing to open-source projects. As a trainee, you help us build a library of educational materials while simultaneously building your own skills.

## What You Will Learn

By following our learning paths, you will gain:

*   **Track Proficiency:** Strong competency in a chosen field like Full-Stack Web, Backend, Mobile, or AI Development.
*   **Architectural Mastery:** An understanding of Clean Code, Design Patterns, and professional application architecture.
*   **Quality Assurance:** The ability to write comprehensive tests (Unit, Component, E2E).
*   **Professional Workflow:** Experience with version control (Git), API design, and other professional practices.

## How It Works: Your Learning Journey

The program is designed to be self-paced. You will follow a series of daily guides to build your knowledge step-by-step.

1.  **Choose Your Path:** Start by looking at the [Learning Paths](./LEARNING_PATHS.md) to decide which technology track you want to pursue.
2.  **Navigate to Your Track:** Go to the corresponding directory inside the `/days/` folder (e.g., `/days/nextjs/`).
3.  **Start with Day 1:** Open the `1.md` file. Read the tasks, explanations, and new vocabulary for the day.
4.  **Complete the Exercises:** The daily guides contain tasks and prompts. While this repository is documentation-focused, we encourage you to perform these tasks locally on your own machine. For example, if a task is "Create a new Next.js project," you should run the commands and build the project on your computer.
5.  **Track Your Progress:** We recommend you maintain your own public fork of this repository. As you complete the daily exercises, commit your notes or related code to your fork. This creates a public record of your progress and learning.

## Getting Started: A Checklist

To begin your journey, please follow these steps:

1.  ✅ **Review the Contribution Guide:** Learn how to contribute effectively by reading our [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
2.  ✅ **Choose Your First Learning Path:** Head over to the [Learning Paths](./LEARNING_PATHS.md) and pick a track that excites you!

## Community & Support

This is a community-driven project. While we don't offer one-on-one mentorship for the trainee program, you can interact with the community in the following ways:

*   **GitHub Issues:** If you find an error in the documentation, have a suggestion, or want to discuss a topic, please open an issue in the repository.
*   **Pull Requests:** If you want to fix a typo or improve a guide, please feel free to submit a pull request!

Thank you for being a part of the MasterFabric Academy. Happy coding!
