| Scenario | Focus Area | Description | Goal |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Initializing a Repository** | How to start tracking a new project with Git. | Create a new local repository. |
| **2** | **Staging & Committing** | The basic workflow of saving changes. | Save your first changes to the repository's history. |
| **3** | **Checking Status & History** | How to see what you've done. | Learn to inspect the state of your repository. |
| **4** | **Ignoring Files** | How to keep certain files out of Git. | Prevent temporary or sensitive files from being tracked. |
| **5** | **Branching** | How to work on different features in isolation. | Create and switch between different lines of development. |
| **6** | **Merging** | How to combine work from different branches. | Integrate changes from one branch into another. |
| **7** | **Resolving Merge Conflicts** | What to do when Git can't merge automatically. | Manually fix conflicts and complete a merge. |
| **8** | **Connecting to a Remote** | How to link your local repository to a remote one (like on GitHub). | Prepare your local repository for collaboration. |
| **9** | **Pushing Changes** | How to share your local commits with others. | Upload your changes to a remote repository. |
| **10** | **Pulling Changes** | How to get the latest changes from others. | Update your local repository with changes from a remote. |

| **12** | **Undoing Changes** | How to revert mistakes. | Learn to use `git reset` and `git revert`. |
| **13** | **Interactive Rebase** | How to clean up your commit history. | Edit, squash, and reorder commits before sharing them. |
| **14** | **Cherry-Picking** | How to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. | Grab a single commit from another branch without merging the whole branch. |
| **15** | **Stashing Changes** | How to save work-in-progress without committing. | Temporarily shelve changes to work on something else. |
| **16** | **Tagging Releases** | How to mark important points in your history. | Create tags for version numbers (e.g., `v1.0`). |
