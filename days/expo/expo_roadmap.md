| Day | Focus Area | Content Details | Goal (From Foundation to Professional) |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-5** | **JavaScript (ES6+) Fundamentals** | Variables, Control Flow, Arrow Functions, Spread/Rest operators. | Solidify modern JavaScript syntax. |
| **6-10** | **Async JS & TypeScript (I)** | **Promises**, `async`/`await`, Basic **TypeScript** types. | Manage asynchronous operations and ensure basic type-safety. |
| **11-15** | **TypeScript (II) & Adv. JS** | **Interfaces**, Custom Types, Advanced Array Methods (**Map/Filter/Reduce**). | Start writing scalable and readable code. |
| **16-20** | **React Basics & Hooks** | Functional Components, Props, **useState** Hook, component lifecycle. | Understand React's component-based architecture. |
| **21-25** | **Expo Setup & Core Components** | Expo CLI, Development Build, **View**, **Text**, **ScrollView**, FlatList. | Get familiar with the Expo ecosystem and core UI components. |
| **26-30** | **Flexbox and Styling** | React Native **Stylesheet**, Advanced **Flexbox** layouts. | Create dynamic, well-aligned interfaces on all screen sizes. |
| **31-35** | **User Input & Project** | **TextInput**, Button, Form validation (e.g., using Formik), complete a simple **To-Do** app. | Handle user input and complete the first MVP. |
| **36-40** | **Navigation** | **React Navigation** setup (Stack, Tab Navigator), Parameter passing. | Standardize and manage application flow. |
| **41-45** | **API Integration (I)** | **Axios** (or Fetch) usage, GET/POST requests, Loading/Error State management. | Establish communication with a remote server. |
| **46-50** | **State Management - Context API**| **Context API** for global state, **useReducer** Hook. | Manage global state without "Prop Drilling." |
| **51-55** | **State Management - Redux/Zustand** | Redux (or **Zustand**) structure, Actions/Reducers, Asynchronous middleware. | Manage complex, global state predictably. |
| **56-60** | **Local Data & Custom Hooks** | **AsyncStorage** and **SQLite** (in Expo) usage, creating reusable **Custom Hooks**. | Reduce code duplication and enable offline data storage. |
| **61-65** | **Architectural Approach** | Separation of Concerns, **Container/Presentational Pattern**, Service Layer implementation. | Organize project files and logic for scalability. |
| **66-70** | **Unit Testing (Jest)** | Writing **Unit Tests** for business logic and reducers, **Mocking**. | Guarantee the correctness of application logic. |
| **71-75** | **Component Testing** | Using **React Native Testing Library** to test UI components based on user scenarios. | Ensure the reliability and usability of the UI layer. |
| **76-80** | **Animations (I)** | **Animated API** fundamentals (Timing, Spring), Interpolation. | Add basic fluidity and dynamic behavior to the app. |
| **81-85** | **Animations (II)** | **React Native Reanimated** or **Moti** for high-performance, native-driven animations. | Develop smooth animations that run off the JavaScript thread. |
| **86-90** | **Expo SDK & Native Access** | Utilizing Expo SDK for Camera, **Maps**, **Push Notifications**, and other native features. | Gain experience integrating hardware and device features. |
| **91-95** | **Performance Optimization** | Using **useMemo**, **useCallback** to prevent unnecessary re-renders, **Flipper** debugging. | Optimize app speed and memory consumption. |
| **96-100**| **CI/CD & Final Project** | Understanding **Expo EAS Build** and Submit processes, basic automation, and final project presentation. | Understand the professional deployment and release cycle. |
